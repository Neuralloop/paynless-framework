**Incomplete Features** // Or In Progress

*   [ðŸš§] Notification System (Phase 1 - see `docs/implementations/20250422_Notifications_and_Tenants.md`)
*   [ðŸš§] Multi-Tenancy Support (Organizations/Teams) (Phase 2 - see `docs/implementations/20250422_Notifications_and_Tenants.md`)
*   [ ] Manage Billing sends user to portal but doesn't return user after action.
    *   **Status:** Verified the `return_url` (`<app-origin>/subscription`) is correctly passed to Stripe via the `createBillingPortalSession` backend handler. Stripe logs confirm it receives the correct `return_url`. The general "Return to..." link in the portal works.
    *   **Issue:** Users are not automatically redirected back to the `return_url` after completing specific actions like cancelling a subscription or updating payment methods; they remain on the Stripe portal page.
    *   **Investigation:**
        *   This seems related to Stripe's portal configuration or the need for more specific API parameters, not the basic `return_url` itself.
        *   Stripe documentation mentions using `flow_data[after_completion][redirect][return_url]` within the `billingPortal.sessions.create` call to configure automatic redirects after specific flows (e.g., `payment_method_update`, `subscription_cancel`).
        *   However, configuring this requires knowing the `flow_data.type` upfront, which is difficult for a generic "Manage Billing" button.
    *   **Next Steps:**
        *   **Required:** Investigate Stripe Customer Portal settings in the dashboard for options to enable automatic redirects after specific actions (like cancellation or payment method update). This is the preferred solution if available.
        *   **If Dashboard Settings Insufficient:** Research further into using the `flow_data` parameter, potentially requiring changes to how the portal session is initiated or handling multiple flow types.
