# Testing Plan: Decentralized Content Distribution System (Synthesized)

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the project, ensuring robustness, security, performance, and usability across all development phases defined in `DEV_PLAN.md`. It aligns with the synthesized plan in `docs/implementations/3. synthesis/synthesis.gemini.md`.

## Guiding Principles

*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD) / Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** Write tests before or alongside feature implementation where practical, especially for core logic, cryptographic operations, protocol implementations, and critical state transitions.
*   **Layered Testing:** Employ a pyramid of tests: extensive unit tests, thorough integration tests, targeted end-to-end (E2E) tests, and specialized tests (security, performance, network simulation, usability).
*   **Continuous Integration & Automation:** Automate test execution (unit, integration, basic E2E, linting, formatting) within CI/CD pipelines to provide rapid feedback.
*   **Security First:** Integrate security testing and analysis (threat modeling, static analysis, fuzzing, audits) throughout the development lifecycle.
*   **Performance Awareness:** Establish performance benchmarks for critical operations early and monitor regressions continuously.
*   **Economic Soundness Testing:** Explicitly test the economic model through simulation and network testing to ensure incentive alignment and resistance to manipulation.
*   **Usability Focus:** Validate the user experience of the client application through dedicated usability testing.

## Testing Types and Scope

### 1. Unit Tests
*   **Goal:** Verify the correctness of individual functions, methods, modules, or classes in complete isolation. Focus on logic, edge cases, and error handling.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Cryptographic primitives and protocols (`core-crypto`).
    *   Data structure manipulation and validation (Merkle trees, DHT routing tables, message schemas).
    *   Parsing and serialization logic for network messages, configuration files, and storage formats.
    *   State transition logic within modules.
    *   Individual smart contract functions (using mock environments).
    *   Client-side business logic (input validation, state management helpers in frontend framework).
    *   Helper functions and utilities.
*   **Tools:** Standard unit testing frameworks (e.g., Rust's `#[test]` infrastructure, potentially `proptest` for property-based testing; Hardhat/Foundry for Solidity unit tests; Vitest/Jest for JS/TS). Mocking libraries (e.g., `mockall` in Rust).

### 2. Integration Tests
*   **Goal:** Verify the interaction and data exchange between different components or modules within the system. Focus on APIs, communication protocols, and data consistency.
*   **Scope:**
    *   **Module Interactions (Rust Backend):**
        *   `core-crypto` <-> `content-manager`: Encryption/decryption during chunking/reassembly.
        *   `core-crypto` <-> `blockchain-adapter`: Signing transactions.
        *   `content-manager` -> `blockchain-adapter`: Publishing meta-hashes.
        *   `p2p-network` <-> `content-manager`: Requesting/serving slices.
        *   `p2p-network` <-> `payment-protocol`: Payment validation for slice requests.
        *   `payment-protocol` <-> `blockchain-adapter`: Verifying/settling payments.
        *   Module -> `storage-layer`: Persistence and retrieval of state.
    *   **Blockchain Interactions:** Smart contract deployment and interactions between contracts (Registry, Payment, etc.) on a local testnet. L2 interaction testing (deposit, withdrawal, L2 transactions).
    *   **Client <-> Backend:** Testing the `tauri-bridge` API (commands and events) by invoking backend functions from simulated frontend calls and verifying results/events.
*   **Tools:** Rust integration tests (`#[test]` in `tests/` dir), local blockchain nodes (e.g., Anvil, Hardhat Network), Tauri integration testing utilities (if available), potentially Docker Compose for setting up dependent services (like a local blockchain node).

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
*   **Goal:** Simulate real user workflows through the entire system, typically interacting via the client UI. Validate complete scenarios from start to finish.
*   **Scope (Key Workflows):**
    *   Creator: Onboarding -> Upload Content -> Publish -> Monitor Earnings.
    *   Consumer: Onboarding -> Discover Content -> Purchase Key -> Download/Stream Content -> (Optional) Start Seeding.
    *   Seeder: Joining Network -> Seeding Content -> Earning Rewards (verification via wallet checks).
    *   Key Management: Backup, Recovery (if implemented).
    *   Payment Disputes (if applicable).
    *   Social Interactions: Posting reactions, following.
*   **Tools:** E2E testing frameworks driving the UI (e.g., Playwright, Cypress), potentially custom orchestration scripts for multi-client scenarios (e.g., simulating P2P interaction between multiple test clients).

### 4. Security Testing
*   **Goal:** Proactively identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities across all system layers.
*   **Scope:**
    *   **Threat Model Validation:** Continuously review and update the threat model (`docs/security/threat_model.md`) as the system evolves.
    *   **Static Analysis (SAST):** Regularly run tools like `cargo clippy` (with security lints enabled), `cargo audit` / `npm audit` (dependency scanning), and potentially specialized Rust security linters. Use SAST for smart contracts (e.g., Slither).
    *   **Fuzzing:** Apply coverage-guided fuzz testing to all untrusted input parsers (P2P messages, file formats, RPC/IPC inputs), cryptographic routines, state machines, and smart contracts.
    *   **Formal Verification:** Where feasible and justified by criticality, apply formal methods to specific algorithms (e.g., consensus logic if custom, core cryptographic protocols, ZKP circuits if used).
    *   **Side-Channel Analysis:** Particularly for client-side key storage and cryptographic operations, analyze potential timing or cache-based leaks.
    *   **Manual Code Review:** Conduct security-focused code reviews for critical components.
    *   **Penetration Testing & Audits:** Engage internal security team members and/or external experts for formal penetration tests and comprehensive security audits (especially for cryptographic code, smart contracts, payment logic, P2P protocols) before major releases (Phase 4).
*   **Tools:** `cargo-fuzz`, `afl.rs`, `bolero` (fuzzing); `cargo audit`, `npm audit`; `clippy`; Slither, Mythril (Solidity); Formal methods tools (TLA+, Coq, KLEE - requires expertise); Dynamic analysis tools; Manual review checklists.

### 5. Performance and Scalability Testing
*   **Goal:** Ensure the system meets defined NFRs for performance, identify bottlenecks, and validate scalability under load.
*   **Scope:**
    *   **Benchmarking:** Measure the performance of critical, low-level operations (encryption/decryption, hashing, signing, key derivation, specific DHT operations, data serialization) using micro-benchmarks. Track over time to catch regressions.
    *   **Load Testing:** Apply simulated load (concurrent users, transaction rates, API calls, P2P connections/streams) to identify throughput limits and breaking points of backend services, blockchain interactions (L2), and P2P network capacity.
    *   **Stress Testing:** Push the system beyond expected load limits to observe failure modes, resource exhaustion patterns (CPU, memory, network, disk IO), and recovery behavior.
    *   **Network Simulation:** Simulate large-scale P2P networks (e.g., 1k-10k+ nodes) with realistic topologies, latency, bandwidth constraints, node churn (nodes joining/leaving), and potential network partitions. Measure metrics like content discovery time, download/streaming success rates, and protocol overhead.
*   **Tools:** Benchmarking frameworks (`criterion` for Rust); Load testing tools (k6, Locust, JMeter); Network simulators (e.g., Shadow, ns-3, or custom simulation environments built with Docker/Kubernetes); Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) to observe system behavior under test.

### 6. Economic Simulation & Testing
*   **Goal:** Validate the designed economic model, test incentive mechanisms, identify potential exploits or undesirable emergent behaviors, and tune parameters.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Simulate scenarios defined in the Economic Simulation Plan (`docs/testing/economic_simulation_plan.md`), including: normal operation, free-riding behavior, collusion attacks (e.g., fake seeding), Sybil attacks on reputation/staking, varying content popularity, network growth/shrinkage.
    *   Measure key economic metrics: Seeder profitability, content availability, fairness of reward distribution, effectiveness of Sybil resistance.
    *   Integrate economic tests into network simulations where possible.
*   **Tools:** Agent-based modeling frameworks (e.g., Mesa, NetLogo), specialized crypto-economic simulation tools (e.g., cadCAD), custom simulation scripts (Python/Rust).

### 7. Usability Testing
*   **Goal:** Ensure the client application is intuitive, efficient, and easy to use for target user groups (creators, consumers).
*   **Scope:**
    *   Task-based testing for core workflows (onboarding, upload, discovery, purchase, consumption, key management).
    *   Observing user interactions, identifying pain points, confusion, and errors.
    *   Gathering qualitative feedback on clarity, layout, and overall experience.
*   **Tools:** User observation (in-person or remote), think-aloud protocols, usability testing platforms/services, heuristic evaluation checklists, user surveys/interviews.
