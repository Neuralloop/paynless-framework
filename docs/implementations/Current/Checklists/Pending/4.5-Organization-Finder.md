# Phase 4.5: Organization Finder & Public Discovery

**Overall Goal:** Implement a feature that allows users to discover, filter, browse, and search for organizations. Public organizations will be displayed with rich details and interaction options. Private organizations will appear in search results with minimal information to confirm their existence, without compromising privacy.

## Phase 4.5.0: [ARCH] Backend Foundations for Organization Discovery

**Goal:** Ensure the backend can efficiently and securely serve a list of organizations, differentiating between public and private entities for display and search.

*   [ ] **4.5.0.1: [DB] Review `organizations` Table for Discovery**
    *   Confirm `visibility` column (e.g., `VARCHAR`, values `'public'`, `'private'`) exists and is indexed.
    *   Ensure fields like `description` (TEXT, nullable), `tags` (TEXT[], nullable), `logo_url` (VARCHAR, nullable), and `allow_public_join_requests` (BOOLEAN) are present for public organizations.
    *   If new columns needed for public orgs, create migration scripts.
*   [ ] **4.5.0.2: [DB] [RLS] RLS Policies for Organization Listing in Finder**
    *   **Public Orgs:** An RLS policy on `organizations` allowing `SELECT` access to all fields relevant for public display (`id`, `name`, `description`, `tags`, `logo_url`, `created_at`, `visibility`, `allow_public_join_requests`) for rows where `visibility = 'public'`. Accessible to `anon` and `authenticated` roles.
    *   **Private Orgs (for search confirmation):** A separate, more restrictive RLS policy (or an extension of the above) that, *when a search term is active*, allows `SELECT` access to minimal fields (`id`, `name`, `visibility`) for rows where `visibility = 'private'` AND the name matches the search term. This allows confirming existence via search without exposing other private data widely. Accessible to `anon` and `authenticated` roles *only through the dedicated finder endpoint with a search term*.
*   [ ] **4.5.0.3: [BE] Create Edge Function for Listing Organizations in Finder (`list-organizations-for-finder`)**
    *   `supabase/functions/list-organizations-for-finder/index.ts` (new):
        *   Method: `GET`
        *   Accepts query parameters: `searchTerm` (string, optional), `tags` (string[], optional for public orgs), `page`, `pageSize`, `sortBy`, `sortOrder`.
        *   Logic:
            1.  If `searchTerm` is provided: Query `organizations` where `name` matches `searchTerm` (e.g., `ILIKE`). This query should be able to fetch both public (more details) and private (minimal details - `id`, `name`, `visibility`) orgs matching the name, respecting RLS.
            2.  If `searchTerm` is NOT provided: Query `organizations` where `visibility = 'public'`. Apply `tags` filter, pagination, sorting.
            3.  The function should return a list of `ListedOrganization` objects (defined in Types), where the structure varies based on `visibility`.
            4.  Return pagination metadata.
*   [ ] **4.5.0.4: [TEST-INT] Write Integration Tests for `list-organizations-for-finder` Endpoint**
    *   Test fetching only public orgs (no search term).
    *   Test with `searchTerm` matching public orgs (rich details returned).
    *   Test with `searchTerm` matching private orgs (minimal details: `id`, `name`, `visibility = 'private'`, no join/contact info).
    *   Test with `searchTerm` matching both public and private orgs.
    *   Test tag filtering (should only apply to public orgs or when listing only public).
    *   Test pagination and sorting.
    *   Test with authenticated and unauthenticated requests.
*   [ ] **4.5.0.5: [COMMIT]** "feat(BE|DB): Setup backend for organization finder (public & private name search)"

## Phase 4.5.1: [API] [STORE] API Client & State Management for Organization Finder

**Goal:** Expose organization listing for the finder through the API client and manage the state on the frontend.

*   [ ] **4.5.1.1: [API] Add Method to API Client for Organization Finder**
    *   `packages/api/src/clients/OrganizationApiClient.ts`:
        *   `listOrganizationsForFinder(params: { searchTerm?: string; tags?: string[]; page?: number; pageSize?: number; sortBy?: string; sortOrder?: string; }): Promise<ApiResponse<{ organizations: ListedOrganization[]; pagination: PaginationMetadata; }>>`
    *   [TYPES] Define `ListedOrganization` in `@paynless/types`:
        *   `interface ListedOrganization { id: string; name: string; visibility: 'public' | 'private'; logo_url?: string; description?: string; // Only for public tags?: string[]; // Only for public allow_public_join_requests?: boolean; // Only for public }`
    *   [TYPES] Define `PaginationMetadata` (if not already existing).
    *   [TEST-UNIT] Write unit tests for this new API client method.
*   [ ] **4.5.1.2: [STORE] Create/Update `usePublicOrganizationFinderStore` (rename to `useOrganizationFinderStore`)**
    *   `packages/store/src/organizationFinderStore.ts`:
        *   State:
            *   `organizations: ListedOrganization[]`
            *   `pagination: PaginationMetadata | null`
            *   `filters: { searchTerm: string; tags: string[]; page: number; pageSize: number; sortBy: string; sortOrder: string; }` (tags filter primarily for public)
            *   `isLoading: boolean`
            *   `error: Error | null`
        *   Actions: (Similar to before, but `fetchOrganizations` calls the new API method)
            *   `setSearchTerm(term: string)`
            *   `setTags(tags: string[])`
            *   `setPage(page: number)`
            *   `setPageSize(pageSize: number)`
            *   `setSort(sortBy: string, sortOrder: string)`
            *   `fetchOrganizations()`
        *   Selectors: `selectListedOrganizations`, `selectPagination`, `selectFilters`, `selectIsLoading`, `selectError`.
    *   [TEST-UNIT] Write unit tests for the store.
*   [ ] **4.5.1.3: [COMMIT]** "feat(API|STORE|TYPES): API client and store for organization finder (public & private)"

---

## Phase 4.5.2: [UI] Frontend - Organization Finder Page and Components

**Goal:** Implement the UI for users to discover, filter, and browse organizations, rendering cards differently for public and private entities.

### 4.5.2.1: [UI] Unified Organization Card Component (`OrganizationCard.tsx`)
*   [ ] **4.5.2.1.1: [UI] [TEST-UNIT] Define Test Cases for `OrganizationCard.tsx`**
    *   In `apps/web/src/components/organizations/OrganizationCard.unit.test.ts`.
    *   Test rendering for `visibility: 'public'`: name, description, tags, logo, "Request to Join" (if applicable), "Learn More".
    *   Test rendering for `visibility: 'private'`: name, generic private indicator/icon, NO description/tags/join/learn more, and a simple message like "Private Organization".
*   [ ] **4.5.2.1.2: [UI] Create Component `apps/web/src/components/organizations/OrganizationCard.tsx`**
    *   Props: `organization: ListedOrganization`.
    *   Displays organization details in a flex card layout.
    *   **Conditional Rendering based on `organization.visibility`:**
        *   If `'public'`: Show `description`, `tags`, `logo_url`. Display "Learn More" button. Display "Request to Join" button if `organization.allow_public_join_requests` is true (triggers `organizationStore.getState().requestJoin` or login redirect).
        *   If `'private'`: Show only `name` and a visual indicator (e.g., an icon and text label: "Private Organization"). Do NOT show description, tags, logo (unless a generic one for private), or any action buttons like "Learn More" or "Request to Join".
*   [ ] **4.5.2.1.3: [UI] [TEST-UNIT] Write tests. Implement. Test until GREEN.**
*   [ ] **4.5.2.1.4: [COMMIT]** "feat(UI): Implement unified OrganizationCard component for public/private listings w/ tests"

### 4.5.2.2: [UI] Filters and Search Component (`OrganizationFinderFilters.tsx`)
*   [ ] **4.5.2.2.1: [UI] [TEST-UNIT] Define Test Cases for `OrganizationFinderFilters.tsx`**
    *   Test rendering of search input, tag selection (multi-select or checkbox group), sort options.
    *   Test that changes trigger actions in `useOrganizationFinderStore`.
*   [ ] **4.5.2.2.2: [UI] Create Component `apps/web/src/components/organizations/OrganizationFinderFilters.tsx`**
    *   Uses `useOrganizationFinderStore` to get current filters and dispatch actions (`setSearchTerm`, `setTags`, `setSort`).
    *   Renders:
        *   Search input (`Input` from `shadcn/ui`).
        *   Tag filter (e.g., `MultiSelect` or a list of `Checkbox` components for available tags - tags could be pre-defined or dynamically fetched).
        *   Sort by dropdown (`Select` from `shadcn/ui` for `name`, `created_at`).
        *   Sort order toggle.
*   [ ] **4.5.2.2.3: [UI] [TEST-UNIT] Write tests. Implement. Test until GREEN.**
*   [ ] **4.5.2.2.4: [COMMIT]** "feat(UI): Implement OrganizationFinderFilters component w/ tests (no change to component itself)"

### 4.5.2.3: [UI] Main Organization Finder Page (`OrganizationFinderPage.tsx`)
*   [ ] **4.5.2.3.1: [UI] Create Page Component `apps/web/src/pages/OrganizationFinderPage.tsx`**
    *   Route: `/organizations/find` (or similar public route).
    *   Layout:
        *   Top section: `OrganizationFinderFilters.tsx`.
        *   Main section: A responsive flex-wrap grid displaying `OrganizationCard.tsx` components.
        *   Bottom section: Reusable `PaginationComponent` (from `Org_Refinement.md` plan).
    *   Uses `useOrganizationFinderStore` to:
        *   Get `organizations`, `pagination`, `isLoading`, `error`.
        *   Dispatch `fetchOrganizations` on initial load and when pagination changes.
    *   Handles loading states (e.g., skeleton cards) and error states.
*   [ ] **4.5.2.3.2: [UI] [TEST-UNIT] Write tests for `OrganizationFinderPage.tsx`**
    *   Mock store, test rendering of filters, cards based on store data, pagination.
    *   Test initial data fetch.
*   [ ] **4.5.2.3.3: [UI] [TEST-INT] Manual Integration Tests**
    *   Test search that returns only public orgs.
    *   Test search that returns only private orgs (minimal cards).
    *   Test search that returns a mix.
    *   Test browsing/filtering for public orgs (when no search term is active).
*   [ ] **4.5.2.3.4: [COMMIT]** "feat(UI): Implement OrganizationFinderPage displaying unified org cards"

---

## Phase 4.5.3: [REFACTOR] Enhancements & Polish

**Goal:** Refine the organization finder feature for better usability and integration.

*   [ ] **4.5.3.1: [UI] "Learn More" Link Destination (for Public Orgs)**
    *   Decide and implement the destination for the "Learn More" link on `OrganizationCard`.
    *   If a public profile page is desired (`/organizations/public/:orgId`):
        *   Define data requirements for this page (org details, perhaps a list of public projects/activities if applicable).
        *   Create a new BE endpoint to fetch these public details by org ID.
        *   Create a new UI page component.
    *   Alternatively, it could link to an external website if the organization provides one.
*   [ ] **4.5.3.2: [UI] Empty States and Loading Skeletons**
    *   Ensure all lists and data displays have good empty states (e.g., "No organizations found matching your criteria").
    *   Implement consistent loading skeletons for cards and lists while data is fetching.
*   [ ] **4.5.3.3: [BE] Optimize Search Performance**
    *   If `searchTerm` performance is slow with `ILIKE`, ensure proper database indexing or implement more robust full-text search with `tsvector` and `tsquery` on relevant columns.
*   [ ] **4.5.3.4: [TAGS] Tag Management Strategy (for Public Orgs)**
    *   If tags are not predefined and can be created by organizations:
        *   Consider how tags are suggested/managed in the filter UI.
        *   Potentially an endpoint to list all unique, currently used public tags.
*   [ ] **4.5.3.5: [UI] Clarify Tag Filter Behavior**
    *   Decide if tag filters should be disabled or hidden when a `searchTerm` is active that might also return private organizations (which don't have tags displayed).
    *   Or, tags apply only to the public subset of results.
*   [ ] **4.5.3.6: [COMMIT]** "refactor(OrgFinder): Enhancements, optimizations, and UI polish for mixed listings"

---

## Phase 4.5.4: End-to-End Testing and Documentation

**Goal:** Ensure the entire feature is robust, well-tested, and documented.

*   [ ] **4.5.4.1: [TEST-INT] Comprehensive E2E Testing**
    *   Test flows for discovering public orgs, filtering, requesting to join.
    *   Test searching for a known private org by name and verifying its minimal card display and lack of actions.
*   [ ] **4.5.4.2: [DOCS] Update Relevant Documentation**
    *   Update user guides on how to find and join organizations.
    *   Update technical documentation regarding new components, stores, and APIs.
*   [ ] **4.5.4.3: [COMMIT]** "test(OrgFinder): Comprehensive E2E tests and documentation for mixed listings"
