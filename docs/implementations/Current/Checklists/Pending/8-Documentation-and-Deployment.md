# AI Chat Enhancements: Implementation Plan

## Legend

*   [ ] Each work step will be uniquely named for easy reference 
    *   [ ] Worksteps will be nested as shown
        *   [ ] Nesting can be as deep as logically required 
*   [‚úÖ] Represents a completed step or nested set
*   [üöß] Represents an incomplete or partially completed step or nested set
*   [‚è∏Ô∏è] Represents a paused step where a discovery has been made that requires backtracking 
*   [‚ùì] Represents an uncertainty that must be resolved before continuing 
*   [üö´] Represents a blocked, halted, stopped step or nested set that has some unresolved problem or prior dependency to resolve before continuing

## Component Types and Labels

The implementation plan uses the following labels to categorize work steps:

* **[DB]:** Database Schema Change (Migration)
* **[RLS]:** Row-Level Security Policy
* **[BE]:** Backend Logic (Edge Function / RLS / Helpers)
* **[API]:** API Client Library (`@paynless/api`)
* **[STORE]:** State Management (`@paynless/store`)
* **[UI]:** Frontend Component (`apps/web`)
* **[TEST-UNIT]:** Unit Test Implementation/Update
* **[TEST-INT]:** Integration Test Implementation/Update (API, Store-Component, RLS)
* **[ANALYTICS]:** Analytics Integration (`@paynless/analytics`)
* **[REFACTOR]:** Code Refactoring Step
* **[COMMIT]:** Checkpoint for Git Commit

## Implementation Plan Overview

This implementation plan follows a phased approach, with each phase building on the previous one:

1. **Project Setup & Planning:** Initialize the project structure, branches, and establish development practices
2. **Database & Backend Foundation:** Implement core database schema changes and RLS policies
3. **API Client Integration:** Update API client methods to support organization context
4. **Store Refactoring:** Modify state management to support organization-scoped chats
5. **Core UI Components:** Implement primary UI components for organization chat context
6. **Bug Fixes:** Address identified user experience issues
7. **Chat Experience Enhancements:** Implement markdown support, token tracking, etc.
8. **Testing & Refinement:** Comprehensive testing and final adjustments
9. **Documentation & Deployment:** Create documentation and prepare for release

## Phase 8: Documentation & Deployment

### STEP-8.1: Create Documentation [üöß]

#### STEP-8.1.1: Update API Documentation [COMMIT]
* [ ] Update API documentation for all modified endpoints:
  * [ ] Document new parameters
  * [ ] Update request/response examples
  * [ ] Add notes about organization context
* [ ] Commit changes with message "docs: Update API documentation for organization chat features"

#### STEP-8.1.2: Create User Guide [COMMIT]
* [ ] Create user documentation for new features:
  * [ ] Organization chat integration
  * [ ] Token tracking
  * [ ] Markdown support
  * [ ] Chat rewind/reprompt
* [ ] Include screenshots and usage examples
* [ ] Commit changes with message "docs: Create user guide for new chat features"

#### STEP-8.1.3: Update Internal Development Documentation [COMMIT]
* [ ] Update development documentation:
  * [ ] Document new state management patterns
  * [ ] Update component interaction diagrams
  * [ ] Document RLS policies and access control logic
* [ ] Commit changes with message "docs: Update internal development documentation"

### STEP-8.2: Prepare for Deployment [üöß]

#### STEP-8.2.1: Create Database Migration Guide [COMMIT]
* [ ] Create a guide for running the database migrations:
  * [ ] List all migration scripts
  * [ ] Document the order in which they should be run
  * [ ] Include any manual steps needed
* [ ] Commit changes with message "docs: Create database migration guide"

#### STEP-8.2.2: Create Deployment Checklist [COMMIT]
* [ ] Create a deployment checklist:
  * [ ] Pre-deployment verification steps
  * [ ] Database migration steps
  * [ ] Frontend deployment steps
  * [ ] Post-deployment verification steps
* [ ] Commit changes with message "docs: Create deployment checklist"

### STEP-8.3: Final Review & Deployment [üöß]

#### STEP-8.3.1: Conduct Code Review
* [ ] Complete comprehensive code review of all changes
* [ ] Address any issues identified during review
* [ ] Ensure all tests are passing

#### STEP-8.3.2: Merge and Deploy [Expanded based on Gemini Plan]
* [ ] Ensure feature branch is up-to-date with the main branch.
* [ ] Create and complete the pull request for `feature/ai-chat-org-integration` into main (addressing any final review comments).
* [ ] Follow the deployment checklist:
  * [ ] Deploy changes to staging environment.
  * [ ] Perform smoke testing on staging.
  * [ ] Deploy changes to production environment.
* [ ] Monitor application logs (Sentry, Supabase logs) for issues immediately after deployment.
* [ ] **REMINDER:** Communicate deployment to team. Remind them to pull changes, potentially run migrations locally if needed, restart servers.
