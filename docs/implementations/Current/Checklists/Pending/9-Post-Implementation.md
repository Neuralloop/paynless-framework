# AI Chat Enhancements: Implementation Plan

## Legend

*   [ ] Each work step will be uniquely named for easy reference 
    *   [ ] Worksteps will be nested as shown
        *   [ ] Nesting can be as deep as logically required 
*   [‚úÖ] Represents a completed step or nested set
*   [üöß] Represents an incomplete or partially completed step or nested set
*   [‚è∏Ô∏è] Represents a paused step where a discovery has been made that requires backtracking 
*   [‚ùì] Represents an uncertainty that must be resolved before continuing 
*   [üö´] Represents a blocked, halted, stopped step or nested set that has some unresolved problem or prior dependency to resolve before continuing

## Component Types and Labels

The implementation plan uses the following labels to categorize work steps:

* **[DB]:** Database Schema Change (Migration)
* **[RLS]:** Row-Level Security Policy
* **[BE]:** Backend Logic (Edge Function / RLS / Helpers)
* **[API]:** API Client Library (`@paynless/api`)
* **[STORE]:** State Management (`@paynless/store`)
* **[UI]:** Frontend Component (`apps/web`)
* **[TEST-UNIT]:** Unit Test Implementation/Update
* **[TEST-INT]:** Integration Test Implementation/Update (API, Store-Component, RLS)
* **[ANALYTICS]:** Analytics Integration (`@paynless/analytics`)
* **[REFACTOR]:** Code Refactoring Step
* **[COMMIT]:** Checkpoint for Git Commit

## Implementation Plan Overview

This implementation plan follows a phased approach, with each phase building on the previous one:

1. **Project Setup & Planning:** Initialize the project structure, branches, and establish development practices
2. **Database & Backend Foundation:** Implement core database schema changes and RLS policies
3. **API Client Integration:** Update API client methods to support organization context
4. **Store Refactoring:** Modify state management to support organization-scoped chats
5. **Core UI Components:** Implement primary UI components for organization chat context
6. **Bug Fixes:** Address identified user experience issues
7. **Chat Experience Enhancements:** Implement markdown support, token tracking, etc.
8. **Testing & Refinement:** Comprehensive testing and final adjustments
9. **Documentation & Deployment:** Create documentation and prepare for release

## Phase 9: Post-Implementation

### STEP-9.1: Monitoring & Support [üöß]

#### STEP-9.1.1: Monitor Application Performance & Logs [Based on Claude 9.1.1 & Gemini Monitoring]
* [ ] Set up monitoring for new features:
  * [ ] Monitor application logs (Sentry, Supabase logs) for any new errors related to chat features.
  * [ ] Monitor analytics dashboards (PostHog) for feature adoption (`chat_created`, `chat_rewind_used`, etc.) and any unexpected user behavior patterns.
  * [ ] Track error rates.
  * [ ] Track performance metrics.

#### STEP-9.1.2: Announce Features & Collect User Feedback [Based on Claude 9.1.2 & Gemini Feedback]
* [ ] Announce new features to users/beta testers.
* [ ] Implement feedback collection:
  * [ ] Add feedback mechanism in the UI (if not already present).
  * [ ] Actively collect and categorize user feedback on the new organization features and chat enhancements.
  * [ ] Prioritize issues for future fixes based on feedback.

### STEP-9.2: Documentation, Backlog & Future Planning [Based on Claude 9.2 & Gemini Docs/Backlog] [üöß]

#### STEP-9.2.1: Update Documentation
*   [ ] Update user-facing documentation/guides for the new chat features.
*   [ ] Update internal technical documentation if needed (e.g., architecture diagrams, store descriptions, RLS policy rationale).

#### STEP-9.2.2: Review Requirements & Document Deferred Features/Backlog
*   [ ] Review "Out of Scope" items from SYNTHESIS #2.
*   [ ] Create/update backlog items/tickets in project management tool for future implementation phases:
    *   [ ] Switching chat ownership (personal ‚Üî organization)
    *   [ ] Granular chat-level permissions
    *   [ ] Real-time multi-user collaboration
    *   [ ] Advanced file handling (beyond basic upload/association)
    *   [ ] Chat branching/versioning
    *   [ ] Organization-level chat analytics

#### STEP-9.2.3: Create Roadmap for Future Enhancements
*   [ ] Create or update a roadmap document:
    *   [ ] Prioritize deferred features and backlog items based on feedback and business value.
    *   [ ] Estimate effort for high-priority items.
    *   [ ] Define success criteria for the next phase of work.

### STEP-9.3: Final Reminders

#### STEP-9.3.1: Commit Reminder [Based on Gemini Reminder]
*   [ ] **REMINDER:** Remind team to commit work regularly during future development cycles.

**Phase 9 Complete Checkpoint:**
*   [ ] Monitoring for application performance, errors, and usage is established and being actively reviewed.
*   [ ] User feedback collection mechanisms are in place and feedback is being processed.
*   [ ] User-facing and internal documentation has been updated.
*   [ ] Deferred features and backlog items are documented and prioritized.
*   [ ] A roadmap for future enhancements is created or updated.
*   [ ] Project officially transitioned to maintenance/support phase or next development cycle.
