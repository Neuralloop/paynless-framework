# AI Chat Enhancements: Implementation Plan

## Legend

*   [ ] Each work step will be uniquely named for easy reference 
    *   [ ] Worksteps will be nested as shown
        *   [ ] Nesting can be as deep as logically required 
*   [‚úÖ] Represents a completed step or nested set
*   [üöß] Represents an incomplete or partially completed step or nested set
*   [‚è∏Ô∏è] Represents a paused step where a discovery has been made that requires backtracking 
*   [‚ùì] Represents an uncertainty that must be resolved before continuing 
*   [üö´] Represents a blocked, halted, stopped step or nested set that has some unresolved problem or prior dependency to resolve before continuing

## Component Types and Labels

The implementation plan uses the following labels to categorize work steps:

* **[DB]:** Database Schema Change (Migration)
* **[RLS]:** Row-Level Security Policy
* **[BE]:** Backend Logic (Edge Function / RLS / Helpers)
* **[API]:** API Client Library (`@paynless/api`)
* **[STORE]:** State Management (`@paynless/store`)
* **[UI]:** Frontend Component (`apps/web`)
* **[TEST-UNIT]:** Unit Test Implementation/Update
* **[TEST-INT]:** Integration Test Implementation/Update (API, Store-Component, RLS)
* **[ANALYTICS]:** Analytics Integration (`@paynless/analytics`)
* **[REFACTOR]:** Code Refactoring Step
* **[COMMIT]:** Checkpoint for Git Commit

## Implementation Plan Overview

This implementation plan follows a phased approach, with each phase building on the previous one:

1. **Project Setup & Planning:** Initialize the project structure, branches, and establish development practices
2. **Database & Backend Foundation:** Implement core database schema changes and RLS policies
3. **API Client Integration:** Update API client methods to support organization context
4. **Store Refactoring:** Modify state management to support organization-scoped chats
5. **Core UI Components:** Implement primary UI components for organization chat context
6. **Bug Fixes:** Address identified user experience issues
7. **Chat Experience Enhancements:** Implement markdown support, token tracking, etc.
8. **Testing & Refinement:** Comprehensive testing and final adjustments
9. **Documentation & Deployment:** Create documentation and prepare for release

## Phase 5: Bug Fixes and Optimizations

### STEP-5.1: Fix Core Chat Behavior Issues [üöß]

#### STEP-5.1.1: Fix Homepage Default Choices [TEST-UNIT] [COMMIT]
* [ ] Create unit tests for the fixed behavior
* [ ] Identify and fix the issue with homepage default choices:
  * [ ] Locate the component or store action responsible for loading defaults
  * [ ] Debug the issue and implement a fix
  * [ ] Ensure defaults are reliably loaded on initial render
* [ ] Run unit tests to verify the fix
* [ ] Commit changes with message "fix(UI): Ensure homepage default choices load correctly"

#### STEP-5.1.2: Fix Dynamic Chat History Updates [TEST-UNIT] [COMMIT]
* [ ] Create unit tests for the fixed behavior
* [ ] Fix the issue with dynamic chat history updates:
  * [ ] Update the AI store to properly trigger updates when new chats are created
  * [ ] Ensure the chat history list component subscribes to these updates
  * [ ] Verify updates occur without requiring page refresh
* [ ] Run unit tests to verify the fix
* [ ] Commit changes with message "fix(UI): Ensure chat history updates dynamically"

#### STEP-5.1.3: Fix Auto-Navigation on Replay [TEST-UNIT] [COMMIT]
* [ ] Create unit tests for the fixed behavior
* [ ] Fix the issue with auto-navigation during chat replay:
  * [ ] Identify the component or action causing incorrect navigation
  * [ ] Update to ensure reliable navigation when selecting a chat from history
  * [ ] Test with various chat states and contexts
* [ ] Run unit tests to verify the fix
* [ ] Commit changes with message "fix(UI): Ensure reliable navigation during chat replay"

### STEP-5.2: Component Optimizations [üöß]

#### STEP-5.2.1: Optimize State Updates [REFACTOR] [COMMIT]
* [ ] Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks
* [ ] Optimize state updates in the AI store:
  * [ ] Use memoization for complex selectors
  * [ ] Minimize unnecessary re-renders
  * [ ] Use batched updates where appropriate
* [ ] Run performance tests to verify improvements
* [ ] Commit changes with message "perf(STORE): Optimize AI store state updates"

#### STEP-5.2.2: Add Loading State Optimizations [REFACTOR] [COMMIT]
* [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates where appropriate:
  * [ ] Show placeholder content during loading (e.g., skeletons).
  * [ ] Pre-render based on expected data shape where feasible.
  * [ ] Add smooth transitions between loading states (Inspired by OpenAI 5.2.2).
  * [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates (e.g., showing user message immediately before API confirmation) where appropriate (Inspired by OpenAI 5.2.2).
* [ ] Run performance tests (manual or automated) to verify perceived performance improvements.
* [ ] Commit changes with message "perf(UI): Add loading state optimizations for better UX"

### STEP-5.3: User Experience Refinements [Based on OpenAI Phase 6.3] [UI] [üöß]

#### STEP-5.3.1: Add User Onboarding for New Features [UI] [COMMIT]
* [ ] Create onboarding components (tooltips, popovers, modals) for new features:
  * [ ] Explaining organization chat context switching and visibility.
  * [ ] Highlighting token tracking features (input estimation, message counts, summary).
  * [ ] Briefly explaining chat rewind functionality.
* [ ] Implement logic to show onboarding elements appropriately (e.g., once per user, on first interaction).
* [ ] Add analytics tracking for onboarding interactions (viewed, dismissed, completed).
* [ ] Commit changes with message "feat(UI): Add user onboarding for new chat features"

#### STEP-5.3.2: Refine UI Based on Testing Feedback [UI] [COMMIT]
* [ ] Conduct internal user testing or review testing feedback collected earlier.
* [ ] Collect and consolidate feedback specifically on the new features and their UI.
* [ ] Implement UI refinements based on feedback:
  * [ ] Improve clarity of context selection/display.
  * [ ] Enhance visual indicators for chat ownership, message attribution, etc.
  * [ ] Refine token tracking displays for better readability.
  * [ ] Adjust layout or styling for improved usability.
* [ ] Commit changes with message "refactor(UI): Refine UI based on user testing feedback"

**Phase 5 Complete Checkpoint:**
*   [ ] All Phase 5 tests (Unit tests for fixes, performance tests) passing.
*   [ ] Core chat behavior bugs (defaults, history update, replay navigation) are fixed.
*   [ ] State updates and loading states are optimized.
*   [ ] Code refactored, and commits made.
*   [ ] Run `npm test`, `npm run build`. Restart dev server and verify fixes/optimizations.
