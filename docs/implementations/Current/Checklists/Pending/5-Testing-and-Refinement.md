# AI Chat Enhancements: Implementation Plan

## Legend

*   [ ] Each work step will be uniquely named for easy reference 
    *   [ ] Worksteps will be nested as shown
        *   [ ] Nesting can be as deep as logically required 
*   [‚úÖ] Represents a completed step or nested set
*   [üöß] Represents an incomplete or partially completed step or nested set
*   [‚è∏Ô∏è] Represents a paused step where a discovery has been made that requires backtracking 
*   [‚ùì] Represents an uncertainty that must be resolved before continuing 
*   [üö´] Represents a blocked, halted, stopped step or nested set that has some unresolved problem or prior dependency to resolve before continuing

## Component Types and Labels

The implementation plan uses the following labels to categorize work steps:

* **[DB]:** Database Schema Change (Migration)
* **[RLS]:** Row-Level Security Policy
* **[BE]:** Backend Logic (Edge Function / RLS / Helpers)
* **[API]:** API Client Library (`@paynless/api`)
* **[STORE]:** State Management (`@paynless/store`)
* **[UI]:** Frontend Component (`apps/web`)
* **[TEST-UNIT]:** Unit Test Implementation/Update
* **[TEST-INT]:** Integration Test Implementation/Update (API, Store-Component, RLS)
* **[ANALYTICS]:** Analytics Integration (`@paynless/analytics`)
* **[REFACTOR]:** Code Refactoring Step
* **[COMMIT]:** Checkpoint for Git Commit

## Implementation Plan Overview

This implementation plan follows a phased approach, with each phase building on the previous one:

1. **Project Setup & Planning:** Initialize the project structure, branches, and establish development practices
2. **Database & Backend Foundation:** Implement core database schema changes and RLS policies
3. **API Client Integration:** Update API client methods to support organization context
4. **Store Refactoring:** Modify state management to support organization-scoped chats
5. **Core UI Components:** Implement primary UI components for organization chat context
6. **Bug Fixes:** Address identified user experience issues
7. **Chat Experience Enhancements:** Implement markdown support, token tracking, etc.
8. **Testing & Refinement:** Comprehensive testing and final adjustments
9. **Documentation & Deployment:** Create documentation and prepare for release

    *   [ ] Review all new/modified code across `supabase/functions/`, `packages/api/`, `packages/store/`, `packages/types/`, `apps/web/`.
    *   [ ] Check for: clarity, efficiency, adherence to project standards (`DEV_PLAN.md`), proper TypeScript usage (types, interfaces), error handling, logging (using `@paynless/utils logger`), potential race conditions, security considerations (input validation, RLS reliance), leftover TODOs/comments.
*   [ ] **Step 6.2.2: [TEST-UNIT][TEST-INT] Test Coverage Review**
    *   [ ] Run code coverage reports (`npm run test:coverage` if configured).
    *   [ ] Identify critical paths or complex logic with low coverage.
    *   [ ] Add missing unit or integration tests to improve confidence. Focus on logic, edge cases, and error handling.
*   [ ] **Step 6.2.3: [COMMIT] Commit Final Refactoring & Test Improvements**
    *   [ ] Stage refactored code and new/updated tests.
    *   [ ] Commit: `refactor: Final code cleanup and improvements for chat enhancements`

    *   [ ] Replace any custom implementations of standard UI elements (Buttons, Selects, Dialogs, Inputs, Tabs, Skeletons, Switches, etc.) with the corresponding `shadcn/ui` components.
    *   [ ] Ensure consistent use of `shadcn/ui` styling, spacing, and theming utilities (`cn` function). (REQ-UX-2.1).
*   [ ] **Step 6.3.2: [TEST-UNIT] Update Component Tests**
    *   [ ] Update unit/integration tests for components that were changed to use `shadcn/ui`. Ensure tests still pass and correctly reflect the new structure/props. Snapshot tests may need updating.
*   [ ] **Step 6.3.3: [COMMIT] Commit UI Standardization**
    *   [ ] Stage modified components and tests.
    *   [ ] Commit: `style(UI): Ensure consistent shadcn/ui usage across chat features`

*   [ ] **Step 6.5.1: [TEST-E2E] Execute Comprehensive Manual Test Plan**
    *   [ ] Re-test all user flows defined in SYNTHESIS #2 (Admin, Member, Individual contexts).
    *   [ ] **Organization Context:**
        *   Create personal chat.
        *   Switch to Org A. Create org chat (as admin).
        *   Switch to Org B. Verify Org A chat not visible. Create Org B chat.
        *   Switch back to Org A. Verify Org A chat visible, Org B not.
        *   As Org A admin, disable member chat creation in settings.
        *   Log in as Org A member. Verify cannot create Org A chat.
        *   Log in as Org A admin. Re-enable member creation.
        *   Log in as Org A member. Verify *can* create Org A chat.
        *   Log in as Org A admin. Delete Org A chat created by member. Verify gone.
        *   Log in as Org A member. Verify chat is gone.
    *   [ ] **Core Chat Features:**
        *   Verify default provider/prompt load.
        *   Verify chat history loads correctly in each context.
        *   Test navigation between many chats.
        *   Test scrolling with long/short messages, fast submissions.

        *   Test Rewind/Reprompt: rewind early, rewind middle, rewind last. Verify history truncation.
    *   [ ] **Error Handling:**
        *   Simulate network errors (e.g., browser devtools offline mode) during message send/load. Verify error messages/boundaries.
        *   Attempt actions without permissions (e.g., member deleting org chat). Verify UI prevents or shows error.
        *   Test empty states (no chats, no messages).
    *   [ ] **UI Consistency:**
        *   Check `shadcn/ui` component usage, loading states (skeletons), context indicators.
