## Legend

*   [ ] Each work step will be uniquely named for easy reference 
    *   [ ] Worksteps will be nested as shown
        *   [ ] Nesting can be as deep as logically required 
*   [‚úÖ] Represents a completed step or nested set
*   [üöß] Represents an incomplete or partially completed step or nested set
*   [‚è∏Ô∏è] Represents a paused step where a discovery has been made that requires backtracking 
*   [‚ùì] Represents an uncertainty that must be resolved before continuing 
*   [üö´] Represents a blocked, halted, stopped step or nested set that has some unresolved problem or prior dependency to resolve before continuing

## Component Types and Labels

2. **Database & Backend Foundation:** Implement core database schema changes and RLS policies
3. **API Client Integration:** Update API client methods to support organization context
4. **Store Refactoring:** Modify state management to support organization-scoped chats
5. **Core UI Components:** Implement primary UI components for organization chat context
6. **Bug Fixes:** Address identified user experience issues
7. **Chat Experience Enhancements:** Implement markdown support, token tracking, etc.
8. **Testing & Refinement:** Comprehensive testing and final adjustments
9. **Documentation & Deployment:** Create documentation and prepare for release
