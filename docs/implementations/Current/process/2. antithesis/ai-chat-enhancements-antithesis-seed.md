We're beginning a new project and have received product requirements documents from three subject matter experts. They are very good at their work, but not perfect. They've may have missed a few things, or misunderstood somehow. We need to do a very close, thorough review to identify the gaps, misunderstandings, and incorrect or incomplete recommendations.

You are very good at helping us refine these plans. Please read each one in turn, then consider their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats, errors, and omissions. Please output a response that details the shortcomings, mistakes, and gaps for each plan so our team of experts can work together to revise, correct, and expand the plans to resolve the problems you identify. 

This is very important work and requires much attention to detail and explanation. We will use your response to generate a comprehensive work plan and checklist for our implementation team. 

Do not be conscise, be verbose. Do not drop or lose detail, we must retain a very thorough understanding of the requirements and proposal in order to plan and implement the work correctly. You will be praised and rewarded for providing a comprehensive review that retains all the prior detail and improves upon it. 

Please output your response as a markdown file that comprehensively and thoroughly criticizes, corrects, improves, and integrates all three plans into a single unified planning overview.

# Product Requirements: AI Chat Enhancements

**1. Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the AI Chat feature within the Paynless Framework. The primary goals are to integrate AI chat capabilities with the multi-tenancy (Organizations) system and to implement various functional and user experience improvements to the chat interface. These enhancements aim to provide a more collaborative, robust, and user-friendly AI interaction experience, aligned with the framework's overall development standards.

**2. Feature Requirements**

**2.1 Organization-Scoped AI Chat Integration**

*   **Rationale:** To enable collaborative use of AI within teams/organizations, allowing chats to be associated with, managed by, and shared within specific organizational contexts.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   **2.1.1 Chat Context Association:** Users must be able to explicitly choose whether a new AI chat session is associated with a selected Organization or kept as a personal chat (unassociated).
    *   **2.1.2 Segregated Chat History:** The Chat History view must visually distinguish between personal chats and chats belonging to the currently selected organization.
    *   **2.1.3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Org Chats:**
        *   Visibility: Chats associated with an organization (`organization_id` set) should only be visible to members of that organization.
        *   Permissions: Access levels within an organization chat should be role-dependent (e.g., 'member' vs. 'admin'). Specific permissions (e.g., viewing, editing history, deleting) need detailed definition. *(Initial scope might grant view access to all members, with management restricted to admins or creators).*
        *   Future Consideration: Define granular chat-level permissions (e.g., who can view, who can contribute, who can manage).
    *   **2.1.4 Organization Admin Management Controls:**
        *   Admins of an organization must have the ability to manage chats associated with their organization (e.g., view all org chats, potentially delete org chats, modify access levels if implemented).
        *   Implement functionality for Org Admins to approve or deny the ability for 'member' role users to create *new* chats associated with the organization.
    *   **2.1.5 Shared Org Chat Visibility:** All members of an organization should be able to view the history of chats associated with that organization, subject to the defined RBAC permissions (see 2.1.3).

**2.2 General Chat Feature Enhancements & Fixes**

*   **Rationale:** To improve the core chat functionality, usability, and adherence to platform standards based on user feedback and identified issues.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   **2.2.1 Correct Homepage Default State:** The main chat interface (potentially on the homepage or `/chat` route) must consistently load with the correct default AI provider and system prompt selections pre-filled as per system configuration or user preferences.
    *   **2.2.2 Dynamic Chat History Updates:** The chat history list must update dynamically in real-time, displaying newly created chats without requiring a manual refresh.
    *   **2.2.3 Consistent Navigation on Replay:** When selecting a past chat from the history ("replay"), the application must navigate reliably to the chat interface with the selected chat loaded, restoring its state correctly.
    *   **2.2.4 Auto-Scrolling Behavior:** The chat message display area must automatically scroll to show the latest message upon submission of a user prompt or receipt of an AI response.
    *   **2.2.5 System Prompt Persistence:** The system prompt selected at the beginning of a chat session must be saved and associated with that specific chat instance. When loading a previous chat, the correct system prompt must be automatically restored.
    *   **2.2.6 System Prompt on Replay:** When initiating a chat "replay" from history, the associated system prompt must be correctly passed to the chat interface to ensure the chat starts in the intended state.
    *   **2.2.7 File Handling (Future Scope - TBD):**
        *   File Attachment: Investigate and potentially implement the ability for users to attach files (e.g., documents, images) to their prompts. *(Requires defining supported types, size limits, security considerations, and backend/AI provider compatibility).*
        *   File Download: Investigate and potentially implement the ability for AI responses containing downloadable content (e.g., generated code, data files) to be presented with a download option.
    *   **2.2.8 Chat Export (Future Scope - TBD):**
        *   Provide functionality for users to export their chat conversations (e.g., as text, markdown, potentially JSON).
        *   Investigate image generation based on chat content.
        *   Investigate allowing users to select specific sections of a chat for export.
    *   **2.2.9 UI Component Standardization:** Refactor existing AI chat UI components to utilize the standard `shadcn/ui` library components where appropriate, ensuring consistency with the rest of the application.
    *   **2.2.10 Loading State Indicators:** Implement loading skeletons (`shadcn/ui Skeleton`) for the chat history list, chat message display area during initial load, and potentially provider/prompt selection lists. Use appropriate button loading states during message submission/AI response generation. (Adheres to `DEV_PLAN.md` standard).
    *   **2.2.11 Error Boundaries:** Implement React Error Boundaries around the main chat interface, chat history list, and potentially other complex chat components to gracefully handle rendering errors and prevent UI crashes. (Adheres to `DEV_PLAN.md` standard).
    *   **2.2.12 Chat Rewind/Reprompt Functionality:**
        *   Users must be able to select a specific point (message exchange) in the current chat history.
        *   Users must be able to edit their prompt at the selected point.
        *   Users must be able to resubmit the edited prompt.
        *   The chat history subsequent to the edited point must be updated or discarded, reflecting the new conversation branch resulting from the resubmission.
    *   **2.2.13 Markdown Input Support:** User input prompts should support standard Markdown formatting, and this formatting should be rendered appropriately (though likely not impacting the raw text sent to the AI).
    *   **2.2.14 Token Usage Tracking & Display:**
        *   Estimate the token count for a user's prompt *before* submission and display this estimate to the user.
        *   Parse and retrieve token usage information (prompt tokens, completion tokens) returned by the AI provider's API response.
        *   Display the token cost associated with each AI response.
        *   Track and display the cumulative token usage (user, assistant, total) for the current chat session.

**3. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Usability:** The chat interface, including organization scoping and new features, should be intuitive and easy to use.
*   **Performance:** Chat loading, message sending/receiving, and history updates should feel responsive. Token estimation should not significantly delay prompt submission.
*   **Security:** RBAC for organization chats must be strictly enforced via backend RLS policies. File handling (if implemented) must consider security implications.
*   **Maintainability:** Code should adhere to existing project structures, patterns (API Client Singleton, Store Action Flow Controller), and documentation standards outlined in `DEV_PLAN.md`.
*   **Extensibility:** The implementation should allow for potential future additions like more granular permissions, different export formats, or support for more AI provider features.
