# AI Chat Enhancements: Synthesis Document

## Product Requirements Document

### 1. Executive Summary

This project aims to enhance the AI chat functionality within our application by integrating it with the existing organization system and improving the user experience. The enhancements will transform the current individual-centric chat experience into a collaborative tool that can be shared within organizations while maintaining appropriate access controls and improving reliability and functionality.

Given that the application is currently in beta with limited users, we will prioritize core functionality over comprehensive migration strategies, advanced features, and other elements that have been identified for future implementation.

### 2. Problem Statement

Our current AI chat system operates primarily at an individual user level, limiting collaboration opportunities within organizations. Additionally, several UX issues and missing features are impacting user satisfaction and productivity. This project addresses these limitations through two primary initiatives:

1. **Organization Integration**: Enable teams to collaborate through shared AI chats with appropriate access controls
2. **Core Chat Improvements**: Fix existing issues and add essential functionality to enhance user experience

### 3. User Personas

1. **Organization Administrator**: Manages organization settings, members, and controls access to shared chats
2. **Organization Member**: Uses AI chat both individually and collaboratively within their organization
3. **Individual User**: Uses AI chat for personal productivity outside of any organization context
