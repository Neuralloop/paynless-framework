# Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI Chat Enhancement & Org Integration

## Overview

This document defines the requirements for enhancing the AI chat experience with robust organizational integration, improved usability, expanded feature set, and maintainable code infrastructure. These upgrades aim to support team-based collaboration, improve chat reliability, and enable scalable and secure interactions with AI across organizational boundaries.

## Goals

- Enable organization-level AI chat usage and management.
- Improve the robustness, user experience, and interactivity of the AI chat interface.
- Ensure security, permissioning, and data integrity across user roles and organizations.
- Provide extensible infrastructure to support future collaboration features.

## Feature Areas

### 1. Organizational Chat Integration

#### Description
Allow users to create and manage AI chats that are shared within an organization, with appropriate access controls and UI separation from personal chats.

#### Requirements

- **Org Chat vs Individual Chat Toggle**  
  Users can specify whether a new chat is tied to their personal account or associated with an organization.

- **Org Chat History View**  
  UI should display separate sections for personal and org-based chat histories.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  Chats scoped to organizations respect access levels (`member`, `admin`). Admins can control chat visibility and deletion.

- **Admin Controls for Org Chats**  
  Admins can:
  - Approve or deny the creation of new org chats.
  - Delete chats.
  - Change access levels.

- **Org-Wide Chat Visibility**  
  All members with access see the same chat history scoped to their org and role.

- **Backend Changes**
  - Add `organization_id` to `chats` and `chat_history`.
  - Update RLS (Row-Level Security) policies to ensure access requires active org membership.

- **API Client Changes**
  - Modify `ChatApiClient` methods to support `organizationId`.
  - Write tests to confirm new behavior.

- **State Management Changes**
  - Update `chatStore` to track chats by `organizationId`.
  - Modify selectors and actions to support org-aware logic.

- **Frontend Updates**
  - Components pull `currentOrganizationId` from `organizationStore`.
  - Update UI for org/person toggle, chat list filters, and permission-aware components.

#### Dependencies
- Active org membership model
- Updated `organizationStore`

### 2. Chat Functionality Enhancements

#### Description
Improve reliability and interactivity of the AI chat interface with fixes and new features.

#### Requirements

- **Chat History Behavior**
  - Dynamically append new chats to the list.
  - Scroll to latest message on submission.
  - Automatically navigate to chat when replaying a message.

- **System Prompt Improvements**
  - Save system prompt with chat metadata.
  - Replay actions restore system prompt state correctly.

- **File Interactions**
  - Users can upload and download files via chat interface.

- **Export Features**
  - Convert chat to downloadable image.
  - Select chat sections to export as a file.

- **Component and Design Upgrades**
  - Convert UI to `shadcn/ui` components.
  - Add loading skeletons and error boundaries.

- **Rewind & Reprompt Functionality**
  - Users can:
    - Rewind to any prior exchange.
    - Edit a previous prompt.
    - Resubmit and update the chat history to reflect new flow.

- **Markdown Support**
  - Allow markdown in user prompt submissions.

- **Token Usage Tracking**
  - Estimate tokens before sending.
  - Show response token usage and cost.
  - Display user, AI, and total token counts.

## Assumptions

- Users belong to one or more organizations.
- Permissions are enforced both client-side and via RLS on the backend.
- Chats must support backward compatibility with existing non-org logic.

## Out of Scope

- Real-time collaboration or multi-user simultaneous editing (future phase).
- Cross-org chat visibility.

## Success Criteria

- Users can toggle between personal and org chat modes.
- Org members can access, create, and manage org chats per their permissions.
- System prompt and replay work reliably.
- Token tracking gives clear feedback on usage and cost.
- New UI components maintain design consistency and reliability.
