# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## AI Chat Enhancement Project

### 1. Executive Summary

This project aims to enhance our AI chat functionality by integrating it with organizations, improving user experience, and adding advanced features. The enhancements will transform the current individual-centric chat experience into a collaborative tool that can be shared within organizations while maintaining appropriate access controls and improving overall functionality and reliability.

### 2. Problem Statement

Our current AI chat system operates primarily at an individual user level, limiting collaboration opportunities within organizations. Additionally, several UX issues and missing features are impacting user satisfaction and productivity. This project addresses these limitations through two primary initiatives:

1. **Organization Integration**: Enable teams to collaborate through shared AI chats with proper access controls
2. **Core Chat Improvements**: Fix existing issues and add new functionality to enhance user experience

### 3. User Personas

1. **Organization Administrator**: Manages organization settings, members, and controls access to shared chats
2. **Organization Member**: Uses AI chat both individually and collaboratively within their organization
3. **Individual User**: Uses AI chat for personal productivity outside of any organization context

  - Add comprehensive test coverage for new parameters

##### 4.2.4 State Management 
- **`@paynless/store` Changes**
  - Restructure chat store to support organization-scoped data
  - Implement organizational context in chat state
  - Update selectors to work with organization context

##### 4.2.5 Frontend Integration
- **`apps/web` Updates**
  - Modify all chat components to respect organizational context
  - Ensure UI properly reflects access-controlled data
  - Update component tests to validate organizational scoping

#### 4.3 Chat Experience Improvements

##### 4.3.1 Bug Fixes
- **Critical UX Issues**
  - Fix homepage loading of default choices
  - Fix dynamic updating of chat history list
  - Fix automatic navigation during chat replay
  - Fix chat scrolling behavior with new submissions
  - Ensure system prompts are saved and correctly loaded with chats
  - Fix system prompt handling during replay actions

##### 4.3.2 File Handling
- **Document Interaction**
  - Implement secure file attachment functionality
  - Create file download capability for chat assets
  - Support common document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)

##### 4.3.3 Export Functionality
- **Chat Persistence**
  - Implement chat-to-image export functionality
  - Create section-based export capability
  - Support multiple export formats (PDF, Markdown, etc.)

##### 4.3.4 UI Modernization
- **Component Updates**
  - Convert existing components to shadcn framework
  - Implement loading skeletons for better perceived performance
  - Add error boundaries for graceful failure handling

##### 4.3.5 Chat Revision Features
- **History Management**
  - Implement chat rewind functionality to specific exchanges
  - Allow users to edit previous prompts
  - Support resubmission of modified prompts
  - Update chat history to reflect edited state
  - Provide visual indicators for edited exchanges

##### 4.3.6 Enhanced Input Options
- **Formatting Support**
  - Add markdown support to user prompt submission
  - Implement preview capability for formatted text
  - Maintain compatibility with existing chat processing

##### 4.3.7 Usage Tracking
- **Token Management**
  - Implement token estimation for outgoing submissions
  - Display token counts for AI responses
  - Track and display aggregated token usage statistics
  - Categorize token usage (user, agent, total)

### 5. Technical Architecture Considerations

#### 5.1 Data Model Changes
The integration of chats with organizations requires significant schema changes:

- New foreign key relationships between organizations and chats
- Enhanced access control mechanisms
- Potential changes to subscription models if they become organization-based

#### 5.2 API Changes
All chat-related API endpoints will need modification to support:

- Organization context
- Access control validation
- Enhanced error handling for permission issues

#### 5.3 Frontend Modifications
The UI will require updates to:

- Manage chat switching between personal and organizational contexts
- Support administrative functions

### 6. User Experience Flow

#### 6.1 Organization Admin Flow
1. Admin creates new organization chat
2. Admin sets default access levels
3. Admin approves member access to chat creation
4. Admin can view, manage, and delete any organizational chat

#### 6.2 Organization Member Flow
1. Member views available organizational chats
2. Member interacts with accessible chats
3. Member can create new chats if approved
4. Member can toggle between personal and organizational contexts

#### 6.3 Individual User Flow
1. User creates and manages personal chats
2. User has clear separation between personal and organizational contexts
3. User accesses enhanced features regardless of context

### 7. Success Metrics

The success of this project will be measured by:

1. **User Engagement**: Increase in chat usage within organizations
