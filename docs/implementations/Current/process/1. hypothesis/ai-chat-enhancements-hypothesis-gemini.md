# Product Requirements: AI Chat Enhancements

**1. Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the AI Chat feature within the Paynless Framework. The primary goals are to integrate AI chat capabilities with the multi-tenancy (Organizations) system and to implement various functional and user experience improvements to the chat interface. These enhancements aim to provide a more collaborative, robust, and user-friendly AI interaction experience, aligned with the framework's overall development standards.

**2. Feature Requirements**

**2.1 Organization-Scoped AI Chat Integration**

*   **Rationale:** To enable collaborative use of AI within teams/organizations, allowing chats to be associated with, managed by, and shared within specific organizational contexts.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   **2.1.1 Chat Context Association:** Users must be able to explicitly choose whether a new AI chat session is associated with a selected Organization or kept as a personal chat (unassociated).
    *   **2.1.2 Segregated Chat History:** The Chat History view must visually distinguish between personal chats and chats belonging to the currently selected organization.
    *   **2.1.3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Org Chats:**
        *   Visibility: Chats associated with an organization (`organization_id` set) should only be visible to members of that organization.
        *   Permissions: Access levels within an organization chat should be role-dependent (e.g., 'member' vs. 'admin'). Specific permissions (e.g., viewing, editing history, deleting) need detailed definition. *(Initial scope might grant view access to all members, with management restricted to admins or creators).*
        *   Future Consideration: Define granular chat-level permissions (e.g., who can view, who can contribute, who can manage).
    *   **2.1.4 Organization Admin Management Controls:**
        *   Admins of an organization must have the ability to manage chats associated with their organization (e.g., view all org chats, potentially delete org chats, modify access levels if implemented).
        *   Implement functionality for Org Admins to approve or deny the ability for 'member' role users to create *new* chats associated with the organization.
    *   **2.1.5 Shared Org Chat Visibility:** All members of an organization should be able to view the history of chats associated with that organization, subject to the defined RBAC permissions (see 2.1.3).

**2.2 General Chat Feature Enhancements & Fixes**

*   **Rationale:** To improve the core chat functionality, usability, and adherence to platform standards based on user feedback and identified issues.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   **2.2.1 Correct Homepage Default State:** The main chat interface (potentially on the homepage or `/chat` route) must consistently load with the correct default AI provider and system prompt selections pre-filled as per system configuration or user preferences.
    *   **2.2.2 Dynamic Chat History Updates:** The chat history list must update dynamically in real-time, displaying newly created chats without requiring a manual refresh.
    *   **2.2.3 Consistent Navigation on Replay:** When selecting a past chat from the history ("replay"), the application must navigate reliably to the chat interface with the selected chat loaded, restoring its state correctly.
    *   **2.2.4 Auto-Scrolling Behavior:** The chat message display area must automatically scroll to show the latest message upon submission of a user prompt or receipt of an AI response.
    *   **2.2.5 System Prompt Persistence:** The system prompt selected at the beginning of a chat session must be saved and associated with that specific chat instance. When loading a previous chat, the correct system prompt must be automatically restored.
    *   **2.2.6 System Prompt on Replay:** When initiating a chat "replay" from history, the associated system prompt must be correctly passed to the chat interface to ensure the chat starts in the intended state.
    *   **2.2.7 File Handling (Future Scope - TBD):**
        *   File Attachment: Investigate and potentially implement the ability for users to attach files (e.g., documents, images) to their prompts. *(Requires defining supported types, size limits, security considerations, and backend/AI provider compatibility).*
        *   File Download: Investigate and potentially implement the ability for AI responses containing downloadable content (e.g., generated code, data files) to be presented with a download option.
    *   **2.2.8 Chat Export (Future Scope - TBD):**
        *   Provide functionality for users to export their chat conversations (e.g., as text, markdown, potentially JSON).
        *   Investigate image generation based on chat content.
        *   Investigate allowing users to select specific sections of a chat for export.
    *   **2.2.9 UI Component Standardization:** Refactor existing AI chat UI components to utilize the standard `shadcn/ui` library components where appropriate, ensuring consistency with the rest of the application.
    *   **2.2.10 Loading State Indicators:** Implement loading skeletons (`shadcn/ui Skeleton`) for the chat history list, chat message display area during initial load, and potentially provider/prompt selection lists. Use appropriate button loading states during message submission/AI response generation. (Adheres to `DEV_PLAN.md` standard).
    *   **2.2.11 Error Boundaries:** Implement React Error Boundaries around the main chat interface, chat history list, and potentially other complex chat components to gracefully handle rendering errors and prevent UI crashes. (Adheres to `DEV_PLAN.md` standard).
    *   **2.2.12 Chat Rewind/Reprompt Functionality:**
        *   Users must be able to select a specific point (message exchange) in the current chat history.
        *   Users must be able to edit their prompt at the selected point.
        *   Users must be able to resubmit the edited prompt.
        *   The chat history subsequent to the edited point must be updated or discarded, reflecting the new conversation branch resulting from the resubmission.
    *   **2.2.13 Markdown Input Support:** User input prompts should support standard Markdown formatting, and this formatting should be rendered appropriately (though likely not impacting the raw text sent to the AI).
    *   **2.2.14 Token Usage Tracking & Display:**
        *   Estimate the token count for a user's prompt *before* submission and display this estimate to the user.
        *   Parse and retrieve token usage information (prompt tokens, completion tokens) returned by the AI provider's API response.
        *   Display the token cost associated with each AI response.
        *   Track and display the cumulative token usage (user, assistant, total) for the current chat session.

**3. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Usability:** The chat interface, including organization scoping and new features, should be intuitive and easy to use.
*   **Performance:** Chat loading, message sending/receiving, and history updates should feel responsive. Token estimation should not significantly delay prompt submission.
*   **Security:** RBAC for organization chats must be strictly enforced via backend RLS policies. File handling (if implemented) must consider security implications.
*   **Maintainability:** Code should adhere to existing project structures, patterns (API Client Singleton, Store Action Flow Controller), and documentation standards outlined in `DEV_PLAN.md`.
*   **Extensibility:** The implementation should allow for potential future additions like more granular permissions, different export formats, or support for more AI provider features.
