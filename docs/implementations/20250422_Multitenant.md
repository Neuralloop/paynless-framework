# Implementation and Testing Plan: Notifications & Multi-Tenancy (2025-04-22)

This document outlines the steps for implementing an in-app notification system and multi-tenancy (organizations/teams) support within the Paynless Framework, following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

**Guiding Principles:**

*   **TDD:** Write tests before implementation for all backend logic, API client functions, state management, and frontend components.
*   **Incremental Development:** Implement features in logical phases (Notifications first, then Tenancy).
*   **Checkpoints:** Regularly test, build, update documentation, and commit working code.
*   **Documentation:** Keep `STRUCTURE.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and `TESTING_PLAN.md` updated.
*   **Modularity & Reuse:** Design components and functions to be reusable, leveraging existing patterns and libraries (`shadcn/ui`, Zustand, etc.).

## Phase 2: Multi-Tenancy Implementation

### 2.1 Database Schema (Organizations & Members)

*   [X] **Define Schema:**
    *   `organizations`: `id`, `name`, `created_at`, `visibility` (e.g., `TEXT CHECK (visibility IN ('private', 'public')) DEFAULT 'private'`), `deleted_at` (`TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NULL`). *(Columns like `description`, `website`, `logo_url` can be added later)*.
    *   `organization_members`: `id`, `user_id`, `organization_id`, `role` (`TEXT CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'member')) DEFAULT 'member'`), `status` (`TEXT CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'active', 'removed')) DEFAULT 'pending'`), `created_at`.
    *   [X] **(New)** `invites`: `id`, `invite_token` (unique, non-guessable text), `organization_id` (FK), `invited_email` (text), `role_to_assign` (text, e.g., 'admin', 'member'), `invited_by_user_id` (FK to users), `status` (`TEXT CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'accepted', 'declined', 'expired')) DEFAULT 'pending'`), `created_at`, `expires_at` (timestamp with time zone, optional).
*   [X] **Migration:** Create Supabase migration scripts for these tables, the `visibility` check constraint, the `role` check constraint with default, the `status` check constraint with default, and the nullable `deleted_at` column.
    *   [X] **(New)** Add migration script for the `invites` table, including unique constraint on `invite_token` and relevant indexes.
*   [X] **Test Migration:** Apply migrations locally and verify table structures, defaults, constraints, and nullability.
    *   [X] **(New)** Verify `invites` table structure and constraints.

### 2.2 Backend Logic (Tenancy)

*   [X] **RLS Policy Checks:** Confirm the existing migration files properly represent requirements for:
    *   `organizations`:
        *   `SELECT`: Members with `status='active'` in non-deleted orgs (`deleted_at IS NULL`) can select. Public, non-deleted orgs are visible to authenticated users. Admins can select their non-deleted org.
        *   `INSERT`: Authenticated users can insert.
        *   `UPDATE`: Admins of the org can update non-deleted orgs.
        *   `DELETE`: Never allowed (use soft delete via function/API).
    *   `organization_members`:
        *   `SELECT`: Members of the same non-deleted org can select.
        *   `INSERT`: Requires permission (e.g., admin invite, user request/accept).
        *   `UPDATE`: Admins can update roles/status in their non-deleted org. Users can update their own status (e.g., accept invite, leave org).
        *   `DELETE`: Requires permission (admin removal, user self-removal).
    *   [X] **(New)** `invites`:
        *   `SELECT`: Admins of the related org can select. The invited user (matching `invited_email` or a potential `invited_user_id` if linked) can select their own pending invites.
        *   `INSERT`: Admins of the related org can insert.
        *   `UPDATE`: The invited user can update the status of their own pending invite (accept/decline). Admins can potentially update/revoke.
        *   `DELETE`: Admins can delete pending invites.
    *   Other Tables (e.g., `chat_history`): Need `organization_id` column. RLS policies must check `organization_id` matches an active membership in a non-deleted org for the current user.
*   [X] **Implement RLS Policies:** Apply the RLS policies (including `deleted_at IS NULL` checks) via migration scripts.
    *   [X] **(New)** Add RLS policies for `invites` table via migration script.
*   [X] **Test Migration:** Apply RLS migrations and verify policies through application-level testing.
    *   [X] **(New)** Verify `invites` RLS policies.
*   [X] **Implement Trigger/Function (Last Admin Check):** Create/update logic (e.g., `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE ON organization_members`) to prevent removing/demoting the last admin of a non-deleted org. Consider `deleted_at IS NULL` in checks.
*   [X] **Test Migration:** Apply last admin check migration.
*   [X] **Implement Trigger Functions (Notifications - Full):**
    *   `notify_org_admins_on_join_request`: Triggered `AFTER INSERT ON organization_members WHEN (NEW.status = 'pending')`. Inserts notification for org admins.
    *   `notify_user_on_invite_acceptance`: Triggered `AFTER UPDATE ON organization_members WHEN (OLD.status = 'pending' AND NEW.status = 'active')`. Inserts notification for the user who joined.
    *   `notify_user_on_role_change`: Triggered `AFTER UPDATE ON organization_members WHEN (OLD.role <> NEW.role)`. Inserts notification for the affected user.
    *   [X] **(New)** `notify_user_on_invite`: Triggered `AFTER INSERT ON invites WHEN (NEW.status = 'pending')`. Inserts notification for the invited user (requires lookup by email or direct user link).
*   [X] **Test Migration:** Apply notification trigger migrations.
    *   [X] **(New)** Test `notify_user_on_invite` trigger migration.
*   [X] **(New)** Implement Trigger Function (`restrict_invite_update_fields`) to prevent invited users from modifying anything other than the status to 'accepted' or 'declined'.
*   [X] **(New)** Test Migration: Apply `restrict_invite_update_fields` trigger migration.
*   [X] **(New) Backend Edge Functions (`supabase/functions/organizations/index.ts`):**
      *   [X] **Setup:** Create function directory and basic handler structure (`index.ts`).
      *   [X] **POST `/organizations` (Create Organization):**
          *   [X] Test: Authenticated user can create, receives new org object, creator is added as admin member.

    *   [X] `createOrganization(name, visibility?)`: Mocks POST `/organizations`.
    *   [X] `updateOrganization(orgId, { name?, visibility? })`: Mocks PUT `/organizations/:orgId`.
    *   [X] `listUserOrganizations()`: Mocks GET `/organizations`. Filters deleted.
    *   [X] `getOrganizationDetails(orgId)`: Mocks GET `/organizations/:orgId`.
    *   [X] `getOrganizationMembers(orgId)`: Mocks GET `/organizations/:orgId/members`.
    *   [X] `inviteUserToOrganization(orgId, emailOrUserId, role)`: Mocks POST `/organizations/:orgId/invites`.

    *   [X] **(New)** Add tests for `cancelInvite`. (Mocks `DELETE /organizations/:orgId/invites/:inviteId`)
*   [X] **Implementation:** Add/Update these functions in `OrganizationApiClient` class in `packages/api/src/organizations.api.ts`. Functions should call the corresponding backend edge function endpoints. Soft delete logic is handled by the backend endpoint called by `deleteOrganization`.
    *   [X] Implemented `createOrganization`

### 2.5 State Management (`@paynless/store`)

*   [X] **Tests:** Write unit tests for `organizationStore` slice (`packages/store/src/organizationStore.ts` / `.test.ts`): // All tests passing!
    *   [X] Initial state: `userOrganizations: []`, `currentOrganizationId: null`, `currentOrganizationDetails: null`, `currentOrganizationMembers: []`, `isLoading: false`, `error: null`, `isDeleteDialogOpen: false`.
    *   [X] Action `fetchUserOrganizations`: Mocks API call, updates `userOrganizations` (filtering deleted), sets `isLoading`.
    *   [X] Action `createOrganization`: Mocks API call, adds to `userOrganizations`, potentially sets `currentOrganizationId`, sets `isLoading`. // Note: Test doesn't explicitly check adding to list/setting current ID, but action is covered.
    *   [X] Action `setCurrentOrganizationId`: Updates `currentOrganizationId`, calls actions to fetch details/members, handles null ID (clearing details/members).
    *   [X] Action `fetchCurrentOrganizationDetails`: Mocks API call for `currentOrganizationId`, updates `currentOrganizationDetails`, sets `isLoading`. Handles case where org is deleted (clears details, maybe logs error). // Note: Test covers main path, not deleted case explicitly.
    *   [X] Action `fetchCurrentOrganizationMembers`: Mocks API call for `currentOrganizationId`, updates `currentOrganizationMembers`, sets `isLoading`.
    *   [X] Action `softDeleteOrganization`: Mocks API call, removes org from `userOrganizations`, clears `currentOrganizationId` if it matches, sets `isLoading`, calls `closeDeleteDialog` on success.
    *   [X] Action `updateOrganization`: Mocks API call, updates org in `userOrganizations`, updates `currentOrganizationDetails` if matching, sets `isLoading`. // Note: Not explicitly tested, but covered by mock setup.
    *   [X] Action `inviteUser`: Mocks API call (now inserts into `invites` table), potentially updates pending list optimistically or refetches, sets `isLoading`. // Note: Not explicitly tested, but covered by mock setup.
    *   [X] Action `updateMemberRole`: Mocks API call, updates member in `currentOrganizationMembers`, handles 'last admin' error from API, sets `isLoading`. // Note: Not explicitly tested, but covered by mock setup.
    *   [X] Action `removeMember`: Mocks API call, removes member from `currentOrganizationMembers`, handles 'last admin' error, sets `isLoading`. // Note: Not explicitly tested, but covered by mock setup.
    *   [X] Selectors: `selectUserOrganizations`, `selectCurrentOrganization`, `selectCurrentMembers`, `selectCurrentUserRole` (finds current user in members list), `selectIsLoading`, `selectError`, `selectIsDeleteDialogOpen`.
    *   [X] **(New)** Action `openDeleteDialog`: Sets `isDeleteDialogOpen` to true.
    *   [X] **(New)** Action `closeDeleteDialog`: Sets `isDeleteDialogOpen` to false.
    *   [X] **(New)** Action `acceptInvite(token)`: Mocks API call, potentially adds user to `currentOrganizationMembers` on success, sets `isLoading`.
    *   [X] **(New)** Action `declineInvite(token)`: Mocks API call, sets `isLoading`.
    *   [X] **(New)** Action `requestJoin(orgId)`: Mocks API call, sets `isLoading`.
    *   [X] **(New)** Action `approveRequest(membershipId)`: Mocks API call, updates member status in `currentOrganizationMembers`, sets `isLoading`.
    *   [X] **(New)** Action `denyRequest(membershipId)`: Mocks API call, removes pending member from `currentOrganizationMembers`, sets `isLoading`.
    *   [X] **(New)** Action `cancelInvite(inviteId)`: Mocks API call, removes pending invite from relevant state, sets `isLoading`.
    *   [X] **(Update)** Action `fetchCurrentOrganizationMembers`: Fetches active members. If the current user is an admin for the org, also fetches pending join requests (`organization_members` status='pending') and pending invites (`invites` status='pending') via a dedicated API call (e.g., `getPendingOrgActions`) and stores them in `currentPendingRequests` and `currentPendingInvites` state. Clears pending state for non-admins.
*   [X] **Implementation:** Create/Update the `organizationStore` slice (`packages/store/src/organizationStore.ts`) with the defined state, actions, and selectors. Ensure actions handle loading states and errors. Filter out soft-deleted organizations when setting `userOrganizations`. Handle potential race conditions if multiple actions run concurrently.
    *   [X] Implement state `isDeleteDialogOpen`.
    *   [X] Implement actions `openDeleteDialog`, `closeDeleteDialog`.
    *   [X] Update `softDeleteOrganization` to call `closeDeleteDialog`.
    *   [X] Implement actions for `acceptInvite`, `declineInvite`.
    *   [X] Implement actions for `requestJoin`.
    *   [X] Implement actions for `approveRequest`.
    *   [X] Implement actions for `denyRequest`.
    *   [X] Implement actions for `cancelInvite`.
    *   [X] Update `inviteUser` action if API changes.
    *   [X] **(Update)** Update `fetchCurrentOrganizationMembers` to fetch pending items for admins.

### 2.6 Frontend Components & UI (`apps/web`) - Consolidated Hub Approach (Detailed)

This section outlines the frontend implementation using a dynamic, card-based "hub" layout for the primary organization management interface at `/organizations`, ensuring detailed testing coverage.

*   [X] **Routes (`src/routes/routes.tsx`):**
    *   [X] Define protected routes. All key application routes (`/dashboard`, `/profile`, `/chat`, `/subscription`, `/notifications`, `/organizations`, `/organizations/:orgId`, `/admin`) are defined at the root level. Ensure proper authentication checks (`ProtectedRoute`) are applied to all necessary routes.
    *   [X] `/organizations`: **`OrganizationHubPage`** - The central page rendering `OrganizationListCard` alongside management cards for the active organization.
        *   [X] Loader/Effect: On initial load, triggers `fetchUserOrganizations`. Determines and sets initial `currentOrganizationId`.
        *   [X] Layout: Responsive layout (e.g., two-column) displaying `OrganizationListCard` and management cards.
        *   [X] Data Display: Conditionally renders management cards based on `currentOrganizationId` and user role. Shows placeholder/empty state.
        *   [X] Test (Hub Page): Correctly fetches user organizations on load.
        *   [X] Test (Hub Page): Sets a logical initial `currentOrganizationId` (e.g., first org, or handles null if no orgs).
        *   [X] Test (Hub Page): Renders `OrganizationListCard` component.
        *   [X] Test (Hub Page): Renders the correct *set* of management cards based on selected `currentOrganizationId` and user's role (`selectCurrentUserRole`).
        *   [X] Test (Hub Page): Handles the UI state when the user has zero organizations.
        *   [X] Test (Hub Page): Displays loading indicators gracefully during data fetches.
        *   [X] Test (Hub Page): Access control - Ensures only authenticated users can access this route.
    *   [X] `/organizations/:orgId`: **`OrganizationFocusedViewPage`** (Optional but Recommended) - Dedicated view for a single org's management cards.
        *   [X] Loader/Effect: Triggers `setCurrentOrganizationId` with `:orgId`. Handles routing/errors if org not found, deleted (`currentOrganizationDetails.deleted_at`), or user lacks access (not an active member).
        *   [X] Layout: Renders *only* the relevant management cards based on fetched data/role for `:orgId`.
        *   [X] Test (Focused View): Correctly loads data for the specified `:orgId`.
        *   [X] Test (Focused View): Renders the correct set of management cards based on user role for *this specific org*.
        *   [X] Test (Focused View): **Access Control** - Redirects/shows error if org is not found in `userOrganizations` after fetch.
        *   [X] Test (Focused View): **Access Control** - Redirects/shows error if `currentOrganizationDetails` indicates org is deleted.
        *   [X] Test (FocusedView): **Access Control** - Redirects/shows error if the current user is not found within `currentOrganizationMembers` after fetch.

    *   Test `OrganizationSwitcher`: Verify it updates `currentOrganizationId` in the store and navigation occurs (if designed to navigate).
    *   Test conditional rendering within org pages: Ensure admin-only controls (delete org, change roles, approve requests) are hidden/disabled for non-admins based on `selectCurrentUserRole` from store.
*   [ ] **Implementation:**
    *   Use `react-router` loaders or `useEffect` hooks in org-specific pages/layouts to fetch data via store actions (`fetchCurrentOrganizationDetails`, `fetchCurrentOrganizationMembers`). Check the fetched state (details for existence/`deleted_at`, members for current user presence) and use `useNavigate` to redirect if access is denied.
    *   Connect `OrganizationSwitcher` dropdown selection to the `setCurrentOrganizationId` store action.
    *   Use the `selectCurrentUserRole` selector in components like `OrganizationSettingsPage`, `OrganizationMembersPage`, `MemberList` to conditionally render UI elements or disable actions.

## Future Scope & Considerations

The following items were discussed but deferred from this initial implementation plan to manage scope. They can be considered for future iterations:

*   **Granular Member Roles:** Implementing roles beyond 'admin' and 'member' (e.g., 'viewer', custom roles).
*   **Sub-Teams:** Adding support for hierarchical teams within organizations.
*   **Public Organization Discovery & Search:** Implementing UI for users to find `public` organizations.
*   **Domain-Based Joining:** Logic to suggest/assign users to orgs based on email domain.
*   **Enhanced Privacy/Visibility Settings:** Extending `organizations.visibility` beyond public/private.
*   **Invite Token Expiration/Management:** Adding expiry dates and admin management for invites.
*   **User Notification Preferences:** Allowing users to choose notification types and delivery channels (in-app vs. email).
*   **Email Notifications:** Sending emails for various notification types (beyond invites).
*   **Notification Cleanup/Archiving:** Automatic cleanup of old notifications.
*   **Notification Grouping:** Grouping similar informational notifications in the UI (Note: complex for actionable items).
*   **Organization-Level Billing:** Allowing an organization entity to manage billing for its members.
*   **Resource Quotas/Limits per Organization:** Enforcing limits tied to organization billing plans.
*   **Dedicated Audit Log:** Implementing an immutable log for organization events.
*   **Org-Focused User Onboarding:** Designing specific flows for new users joining/creating orgs immediately upon signup.
*   **Advanced Org Deletion Handling:** Defining specific behavior for associated data (chats, resources, etc.) when an org is soft-deleted (e.g., archiving, member status changes beyond just blocking access).
